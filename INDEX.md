## ✨ Key Information

### Deployment Architecture
```
GitHub (Your Code)
  ↓
Render (Backend API) + Vercel (Frontend) + Hostinger (Database)
  ↓
https://yourdomain.com
```

### Before You Start, You Need:
- [ ] GitHub account (free at github.com)
- [ ] Render account (free at render.com)
- [ ] Vercel account (free at vercel.com)
- [ ] Hostinger account (paid, but cheapest option for all services)

### Estimated Timeline
- Reading docs: 15 minutes
- Restructuring: 15 minutes
- GitHub push: 5 minutes
- Render setup: 20 minutes
- Vercel setup: 15 minutes
- Hostinger setup: 15 minutes
- Testing: 15 minutes
- **Total: ~100 minutes**

---

## 🔑 Key Points to Remember

1. **Don't commit .env files** - Use environment variables on platforms
2. **Read guides carefully** - They're in the right order for a reason
3. **Test after each step** - Catch errors early
4. **Whitelist Render IP** on Hostinger - Critical for database access
5. **Update CORS_ORIGINS** - After Vercel deployment
6. **Save your credentials** - You'll need them for environment variables
7. **DNS takes time** - Can take 5-48 hours to propagate
